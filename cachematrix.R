# These functions are created as part of the week 3 programming assignment for
# the R Programming course on coursera.They reduce the run time when calculating
# the inverse of a large matrix in a loop by taking advantage of R's lexical
# scoping rules by using a cache.
 

# This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
# Argument x must be a square invertible matrix.

  getinv <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get, setinv = setinv, getinv = getinv)

# This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by
# makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the
# matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from
# the cache.
